//allow the hook to accept param titles of type array string
//document title should animate i.e. when the tab loses focus
// js allows for a visibility change event
// as soon as the hook mounts; you can begin to listen to events using react's use-event-hook
//https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-use-event-hook
// make sure that it fires on mount only -- i.e.
